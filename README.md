# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Automate business processes by building a **machine learning** pipeline that predicts the total duration of a New York City taxi trip. This enables accurate fare estimation based on US taxi pricing rules (fixed fees plus time- and distance-based tariffs).

## Business Context

Taxi and ride-hailing services need reliable trip duration forecasts for route planning, pricing transparency, and customer satisfaction. By predicting ride time from features such as pickup/dropoff locations, time of day, and weather, our model helps optimize both business operations and end-user experience.

## Project Objectives

- **Build unified dataset:** Integrate trips with weather and geospatial data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Design new predictors and select the strongest features.
- **EDA & Visualization:** Reveal key insights and patterns in the data.
- **Modeling:** Evaluate multiple regression algorithms for prediction.
- **Deployment Workflow:** Automate end-to-end prediction for new rides.
- **Kaggle Submission:** Showcase results in a live data science competition.

## Data Sources

- NYC taxi ride datasets (pickup/dropoff, timestamp, trip length)
- Open weather datasets
- Geospatial info

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyc-taxi-trip-duration.git
cd nyc-taxi-trip-duration


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download all datasets (see `data/README.md` for sources) and use the provided notebooks for analysis and experiments.

## Main Workflow

- **Data merging & cleaning**
- **Feature engineering:** Compute distances, time intervals, join weather info, extract temporal features
- **Exploration:** Analyze trends, outliers, and correlations
- **Modeling:** Train and compare regression models (e.g., linear, ensemble, boosting)
- **Evaluation:** Use RMSE, MAE for model selection

## Results & Insights

Our best model achieves robust accuracy on public test sets (metrics and feature importances available in the `notebooks/results` section). Top features include route length, pickup time, and weather factors.
